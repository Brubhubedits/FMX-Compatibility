> - **DO NOT RUN ANYTHING THAT WRITES TO THE NAND! YOU WILL BRICK YOUR CONSOLE!**
> - **Always use a non-Xbox Live account** when running homebrew and **do not connect to the internet.**
> - Homebrew that will get you **almost definitely banned** from Xbox Live will be marked with üë§ if you insist on connecting to the internet/using an Xbox Live account.

> [!NOTE]
> - Remember to patch your apps! Follow either tutorial in the [Wiki](https://github.com/XDanfr/FMX-Compatibility/wiki).

| Homebrew Title          | Works? | Method | Notes (Crashes, Fixes, Patches)                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------------------|:------:|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aurora                  |   ‚úÖ   | XexTool | Covers will not install if you are offline, so you'll have to use [Aurora Asset Editor](https://github.com/XboxUnity/AuroraAssetEditor/) and download covers manually.<br><br>(beta 4 and above only), you can now connect to the internet and the assets will be automatically downloaded from [XboxUnity](http://xboxunity.net). **NOTE: You still need to disconnect from the internet before running the exploit again**   |
| DashLaunch              |   ‚ö†Ô∏è   | XexTool | **Do not install DashLaunch when prompted.** Runs, but is functionless at the moment. (Tested on beta 2, try beta 3 whenever possible)                                   |
| Freestyle 3             |   ‚úÖ   | XexTool | I tried the patched version of FSD 3 that fixes all bugs and it runs great. **Do not set it as the default dashboard.**                                                  |
| Snes360                 |  ‚úÖ üë§ | XexTool | Runs ROMs with no issue. **NOTE: You immediately receive an achievement as soon as you launch the emulator with a profile logged in, and will most likely be why your console is banned if you run the emulator on an Xbox Live-enabled profile.**                                                                                                                                                       |
| Simple 360 NAND Flasher |   ‚úÖ   | XexTool | Successfully dumps your NAND to your Bad Update USB. **Obviously**, do not place an updflash.bin beside the homebrew's XEX or try to flash your NAND in any way.         |
| XeXmenu                 |   ‚úÖ   | XexTool | Works as expected, no issues found :D (Tested on beta 3)                                                                                                                 |
| XM360                   |   ‚úÖ   | XexTool | XBLA games and DLC can be unlocked using XM360. **NOTE: This will prevent them from launching without being in a modded state, so back up your games before unlocking.** |
