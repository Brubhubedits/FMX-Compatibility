> [!WARNING]
> From now on, reports should include which patching method was used to get games to run.

> [!WARNING]
> for Original Xbox, you need to update FreeMyXe to beta 4 and further, then you need to run **"OGXboxPrep.xex"** to allow you to run OG Xbox games, once you are done with that, you need to run **"OGXboxPrep"** again to continue playing Xbox 360 Games
>
> To play your OG Xbox Backups, you need to replace the **"Compatibility"** folder from HddX: with the Modded Versions of Xefu, be sure to backup the Original Folder before doing so
