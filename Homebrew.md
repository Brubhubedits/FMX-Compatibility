| Homebrew Title          | Works? | Notes (Crashes, Fixes, Patches)                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Aurora                  |   ‚úÖ    | Covers will not install if you are offline, so you'll have to use [Aurora Asset Editor](https://github.com/XboxUnity/AuroraAssetEditor/)                                                                                                           |
| DashLaunch              |   ‚ö†Ô∏è   | **Do not install DashLaunch when prompted.** Runs, but is functionless at the moment. (Tested on beta 2, try beta 3 whenever possible)                                                                                                             |
| Freestyle 3             |   ‚úÖ    | I tried the patched version of FSD 3 that fixes all bugs and it runs great. **Do not set it as the default dashboard.**                                                                                                                            |
| Snes360                 |  ‚úÖ üë§  | Runs ROMs with no issue. **NOTE: You immediately receive an achievement as soon as you launch the emulator with a profile logged in, and will most likely be why your console is banned if you run the emulator on an Xbox Live-enabled profile.** |
| Simple 360 NAND Flasher |   ‚úÖ    | Successfully dumps your NAND to your Bad Update USB. **Obviously**, do not place an updflash.bin beside the homebrew's XEX or try to flash your NAND in any way.                                                                                   |
| XeXmenu                 |   ‚úÖ    | Works as expected, no issues found :D (Tested on beta 3)                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| XM360                   |   ‚úÖ    | XBLA games and DLC can be unlocked using XM360. **NOTE: This will prevent them from launching without being in a modded state, so back up your games before unlocking.**                                                                           |
