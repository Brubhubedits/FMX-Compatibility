| Aurora                  |   ‚úÖ   | XexTool | Covers will not install if you are offline, so you'll have to use [Aurora Asset Editor](https://github.com/XboxUnity/AuroraAssetEditor/) and download covers manually.<br><br>(beta 4 and above only), you can now connect to the internet and the assets will be automatically downloaded from [XboxUnity](http://xboxunity.net). **NOTE: You still need to disconnect from the internet before running the exploit again**                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| DashLaunch              |   ‚ö†Ô∏è   | XexTool | **Do not install DashLaunch when prompted.** Runs, but is functionless at the moment. (Tested on beta 2, try beta 3 whenever possible)                                   |
| Freestyle 3             |   ‚úÖ   | XexTool | I tried the patched version of FSD 3 that fixes all bugs and it runs great. **Do not set it as the default dashboard.**                                                  |
| Snes360                  |   ‚úÖ üë§   | XexTool | Runs ROMs with no issue. **NOTE: You immediately receive an achievement as soon as you launch the emulator with a profile logged in, and will most likely be why your console is banned if you run the emulator on an Xbox Live-enabled profile.**                                                                                                                                                       |
| Modded Xefu Emulator                 |  ‚úÖ  | None | Remember to Run "OGXboxPrer.xex" to play your OG Xbox Game, replace the original compatibility folder From HddX: to allow you to run Backup, for a compatibily list of the games, use this [Site](https://consolemods.org/wiki/Xbox_360:Original_Xbox_Games_Compatibility_List#Compatibility_List)                                                                                                                                                       |
| Simple 360 NAND Flasher |   ‚úÖ   | XexTool | Successfully dumps your NAND to your Bad Update USB. **Obviously**, do not place an updflash.bin beside the homebrew's XEX or try to flash your NAND in any way.         |
| XeXmenu                 |   ‚úÖ   | XexTool | Works as expected, no issues found :D (Tested on beta 3)                                                                                                                 |
