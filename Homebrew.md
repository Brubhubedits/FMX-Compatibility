> [!CAUTION]
> - **DO NOT RUN ANYTHING THAT WRITES TO THE NAND! YOU WILL BRICK YOUR CONSOLE!**
> - **Always use a non-Xbox Live account** when running homebrew and **do not connect to the internet.**
> - Homebrew that will result in your account and/or console being **almost definitely banned** from Xbox Live will be marked with üë§ if you attempt to connect to the internet/use an Xbox Live account.

> [!NOTE]
> - **Remember to patch your apps!** If necessary, follow one of the tutorials in the [Wiki](https://github.com/XDanfr/FMX-Compatibility/wiki) to ensure proper functionality.
> - Emulators are listed separately from homebrew. See [Emulators](#emulators)
> - DashLaunch plugins (e.g. Stealth servers, XBDM) don't work as it can't be installed.
> - > - If Homebrew is listed as `‚ùå Borked` or `‚ö†Ô∏è Partial` in a specific format, try converting via another method. It might work completely!! (This doesn't apply to DashLaunch)
