| Homebrew Title | Works? | Notes (Crashes, Fixes, Patches) |
|--------------------|:------:|---------------------------------|
| Aurora         | ✅     | I've seen so many people use it perfectly without any issues and can say the same for myself. |
| DashLaunch     | ⚠️     | DO NOT PRESS INSTALL! YOU WILL BRICK YOUR CONSOLE! It runs afterwards but there's no real use that I'm aware of. (Tested on beta 2, try beta 3 whenever possible) |
| Freestyle 3    | ✅     | I tried the patched version of FSD 3 that fixes all bugs and it runs great. **Don't set it as the default dash just to be safe.**
| XeXmenu        | ✅     | Works as expected, no issues found :D (Tested on beta 3)|
